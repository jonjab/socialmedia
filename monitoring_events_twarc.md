# Monioring Events Using Twarc's Filter and Search 

A narrative guide outlining how to start a search and a filter and combine the results once the event is over. 

*Maybe make it so they can watch the video but also just look at the screenshot step-by-step example for review. 

*JJ did a BLM non-event last May that might be a good example. We can do it in memory of Daunte Wright. Or we can choose something that will inevitably happen in the next couple of weeks.*

## Before You Start

Before starting this guide, make sure you have [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) installed and setup. 

## Step 1

Next you're going to want to run _twarc filter_ and _twarc search_. There are a couple of ways this can be done, but the most preferable is to run two command line windows.


## Step 2
*could dehydrate and conbine ids*
*or combine jsonl*

## Step 3
*use deduplicate to take out same tweets over and over*

## Step 4
*analyze combined dataset using twarc utilities*
