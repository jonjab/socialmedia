‘New guide: monitoring an event with twarc.  Make a narrative guide outlining how to start a search and a filter and combine the results together once the event is over.  JJ did a BLM non-event last May that might be a good example. We can do it in memory of Daunte Wright. Or we can choose something that will inevitably happen in the next couple of weeks. But let’s please make it BLM.’
